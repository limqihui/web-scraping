## web-scraping
During my Media Analytics internship, I was responsible for tracking follower counts across multiple social media profiles on different platforms. Noticing that this repetitive task was both time-consuming and prone to errors, I took the initiative to streamline the process. I independently learned Python and developed a web scraping solution to automate data collection. This approach allowed me to complete the task with significantly improved efficiency and accuracy, enhancing the reliability of the analytics reports.
